Introduction and Data Summary
</b></p>

**Introduction**



According to the that reduces the time buses wait curbside, creating an efficiency for the system

**Research Question**

Our group is interested in exploring the cash use as transit fare payment method in the Greater Seattle area.

Whether cash has a big stake in transit fare payment methods among riders in the Greater Seattle area and if so, who are most likely to pay cash


1) Are cash payments still have a big stake in transit fare types among riders in the Greater Seattle area?
2) What type of fare is the most common given different purpose of trips?
3).....

**Data**

The data we use for the research is the [Seattle Sound Transit Survey Data](https://github.com/karllovepolicy/Data_Visual_Final_Tutorial/raw/master/OriginalData.csv), collected on different Sound Transit routes during October-November 2015. The full original dataset contains 134 variables and 3398 observations. 

Our variable of interest is fare type (named as "faretype"), which means what method of payment was used by a rider to pay a transit fare. Later, we transform this variable into the dummy variable with the values (Cash/Not Cash), which we further use as the dependent variable for the regressin analysis to assess the impact of chosen explanatory variables on the likelihood of using cash as the transit fare payment method.

The independent variables we used for the research include:


The dataset has a lot of missing values. For the purpose of this research, we drop the whole observation if there is a missing value in one of the variables of interests.

Data Pre-processing
</b></p>

First we need to call the libraries to be able to use the packages 

```{r load library, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)
```
Then we need to call the data we want to analyze. In our case we call the csv file

```{r import data, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
linkdata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karllovepolicy/Data_Visual_Final_Tutorial/master/OriginalData.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(linkdata)
```

```{r}
#change names of explanatory variables
linkdata <- rename(linkdata,'number_of_trips'='oneway_all_clean', 'vehicle'='hhveh_clean', "income"="hhincome")

unique(linkdata$faretype)
```
We noticed "False" here, need to change it to "Other".
```{r}
linkdata <- linkdata %>% 
  mutate(faretype = recode(faretype, 'FALSE' = "Other"))
```


```{r purpose}
unique(linkdata$purpose)
```

```{r income}
unique(linkdata$income)
```

```{r clean income name}
#the category of income need some work
linkdata <- linkdata %>% mutate(income = recode(income, 
                                    "16,000-$19,999"="$16,000-$19,999",
                                    "12000-15999" ="$12,000-$15,999",
                                    "Under 12000"="Under $12,000")) 
#regroup income levels based on Seattle 2015 Household Income Quantile, https://www.kingcounty.gov/independent/forecasting/King%20County%20Economic%20Indicators/Household%20Income/KC%20Household%20Income%20Quintiles.aspx
lowest_income <- c("Under $12000","$12,000-$15,999", "$16,000-$19,999", "$20,000-$23,999", "$24,000-$31,999", "$32,000-$39,999")
medium_low_income <- c("$40,000-$48,999", "$57,000-$74,999", "$49,000-$56,999")
medium_high_income <-c("$75,000-$99,999")
highest_income <- c("$100,000+")

linkdata <- linkdata %>% mutate(income = case_when(
  income %in% lowest_income~"lowest",
  income %in% medium_low_income~"medium_low",
  income %in% medium_high_income~"medium_high",
  income %in% highest_income~"highest"))
```

```{r vehicle}
unique(linkdata$vehicle)
```

```{r number of trips}
unique(linkdata$number_of_trips)
```

```{r get ride of missing values, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mydata1 <- linkdata %>%
  filter(faretype != "#NULL!") %>%
  filter(purpose != "#NULL!") %>% 
  filter(income != "NA") %>% 
  filter(vehicle != "#NULL!") %>% 
  filter(number_of_trips != "#NULL!")
```

```{r multi transform binamiry variable_cash, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# these variable are all characters, we need to transform, some to numeric, some to factor
mydata1$vehicle <- as.numeric(mydata1$vehicle)
# subset, transform faretype and vehicle binary variables, select needed variables:
mydata2 <- mydata1 %>% mutate(cashlove = ifelse(faretype=="Cash", 1, 0), vehicle = ifelse(vehicle>0, 1, 0)) %>% select(faretype, cashlove, purpose, income,  vehicle, number_of_trips) 

#mydata2$faretype <- factor(mydata2$faretype)

# set the right type for dependent variable
#from num to factor
mydata2$cashlove <- factor(mydata2$cashlove)

# set the correct type for explanatory variables
#reset the level of variable "purpose"
mydata2$purpose <- factor(mydata2$purpose) 
#from cha to factor, set right level for factor
mydata2$income <- factor(mydata2$income) 
#mydata2$income <- factor(mydata2$income, levels=rev(levels(sizes)))
#from num to factor
mydata2$vehicle <- factor(mydata2$vehicle)
#from cha to numeric
mydata2$number_of_trips <- as.numeric(mydata2$number_of_trips)#-1

head(mydata2,5)
# transform explanatory varibles from factor to numeric, add "-1" in command because Factors in R are represented internally as integers and the first factor is 1.
```
Format of variables are right, we are good to go!

```{r export dataset}
write.csv(mydata2, file = "FinalData.csv")
```

#Question 1: Is cash still used as payment for transit? 
**Finalizing the data frame for univariable ggplot**

We will need to separate data we are interested to analyze (subsetting the data), and calculate the frequences

```{r}
absol_ft=table(mydata2$faretype, exclude = 'nothing')
ft_freq=prop.table(absol_ft)*100
ft_freq_df=as.data.frame(ft_freq) 
names(ft_freq_df)=c("faretype","pct")

#ft_freq_df$faretype <- sort(ft_freq_df$faretype,-ft_freq_df$pct)
#ft_freq_df<- ft_freq_df %>% arrange(faretype,-pct)\
#ft_freq_df$faretype= factor(ft_freq_df$faretype, levels=ft_freq_df$faretype[order()]), ordered=TRUE)
ft_freq_df
```

Now we can build a bar plot to visualize how frequently each of the payment methods is used. Since our primary focus is cash, we want to highlight it by using the red color for the bar which represents cash. 
```{r barplot}
#cols <- ifelse(ft_freq_df$faretype == "Cash", "red","gray50")
#something wrong with color, fix now
base = ggplot(ft_freq_df, aes(x=reorder(faretype, pct),y=pct))
ft_plot1 = base + geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="gray50", width = 0.75)
ft_plot2 = ft_plot1 + labs(title='Do riders still use cash to pay a transit fare in Seattle?', #to label the graph 
                           x ='Type of fare',
                           y = 'Percentage of riders',
                           caption = 'Source: Sound Transit 2015 Onboard Survey Data')
ft_plot3 = ft_plot2 + coord_flip() 
ft_plot4 = ft_plot3 #+ scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,55),
                                    # breaks = seq(0, 55, by = 5)+ 
                                    # labels=unit_format(suffix = '%')) +
                            #scale_x_discrete(limits=ft_freq_df$faretype)
ft_plot4 = ft_plot3 + geom_text(aes(y = pct,
                                label = paste0(round(pct,2), '%')), 
                                hjust= -0.15, 
                                size = 3)
ft_plot5 = ft_plot4 + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "black"),
                            plot.title = element_text(size = 15, hjust = 0.5),
                            plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = -1.2),
                            axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 1.75),
                            axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1.25))
ft_plot5
```


#Question 2: Who is using cash?

Now, we will try to answer what type of fare is the most common given different purpose of trips and different income groups.

**Cleaning the data and creating the proportion table for faretype VS. Purpose**

We will first need to clean the data so that there are no missing values

```{r}
FarePurpose=table(mydata2$faretype, mydata2$purpose)%>% 
         prop.table(margin = 2)%>%   # 2 is % by column 
         "*"(100)%>% 
         round(3)
```

Same as with the barplot, we will need to create a data frame

```{r dflink}
dfFarePurpose=as.data.frame(FarePurpose)
names(dfFarePurpose)=c('Faretype','Purpose','Percent')
```

**Building the faretype VS. Purpose plot**

```{r barplotfarepurpose}
base  = ggplot(dfFarePurpose, aes(x = reorder(Faretype, Percent), y = Percent))
bars1 = base + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
bars2 = bars1 + facet_wrap( ~ Purpose ,nrow = 1)
bars3 = bars2 + coord_flip() + 
                scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,80),
                                  labels=scales::unit_format(suffix = '%'))
bars4 = bars3 + geom_text(aes(y = Percent,
                                  label = paste0(round(Percent,1), '%')), 
                                  hjust= -0.15, 
                                  size = 2.5)
bars5 = bars4 + labs(title='What fare type is the most common given different purpose of trips?',
                     x ='Fare type',
                     caption = 'Source: Sound Transit 2015 Onboard Survey Data')
bars6 = bars5 + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=8, angle = 30),
                      axis.text.x = element_text(size=7),
                      plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
                      plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = -1.2),
                      axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 1.75),
                      axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1.25))
bars6
```

**Cleaning the data and creating the proportion table for faretype VS. Income**
```{r}
FareIncome=table(mydata2$faretype, mydata2$income)%>%
         prop.table(margin = 2)%>%   # 2 is % by column
         "*"(100)%>%
         round(3)
```

Same as with the barplot, we will need to create a data frame

```{r}
dfFareIncome=as.data.frame(FareIncome) 
names(dfFareIncome)=c('Faretype','Income','Percent')
dfFareIncome
```
**Building the faretype VS. Purpose plot**
```{r}
base  = ggplot(dfFareIncome, aes(x = reorder(Faretype, Percent), y = Percent))
bars1 = base + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
bars2 = bars1 + facet_wrap( ~Income,nrow = 3)
bars3 = bars2 + coord_flip() + 
                scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,80),
                                  labels=scales::unit_format(suffix = '%'))
bars4 = bars3 + geom_text(aes(y = Percent,
                                  label = paste0(round(Percent,1), '%')), 
                                  hjust= -0.15, 
                                  size = 2.5)
bars5 = bars4 + labs(title='What fare type is the most common given different income level?',
                     x ='Fare type',
                     caption = 'Source: Sound Transit 2015 Onboard Survey Data')
bars6 = bars5 + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=8, angle = 30),
                      axis.text.x = element_text(size=7),
                      plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),

#Question 3: What's the impact of explanatory variables on cash usage?

In this section, we will explore the realationship among the probability of using cash for this trip, whether people have vehicles, the purpose of this trip, and frequency of using public transportation. 


**Doing Regression with logit model** 

Here we use logit model since our dependent variable is a binary variable. Our reference group is people who has lowest income, whose purpose of this trip is home-based non-work trip and don't have vehicles at home.
```{r set the reference group}
mydata2 <- within(mydata2, income <- relevel(income, ref = "lowest"))
mydata2 <- within(mydata2, purpose <- relevel(purpose, ref = "Home Based Non-Work Trip"))

```


```{r logit regression, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dotwhisker)
library(broom)
#just use purpose as explantary variable
mylogit1 <- glm(cashlove ~ purpose, data = mydata2, family = "binomial")
model1 = tidy(mylogit1) %>%   # we save the result as a tidy object and...
    mutate(model = "Model 1")
#use 
mylogit2 <- glm(cashlove ~ purpose + vehicle, data = mydata2, family = "binomial")
model2 = tidy(mylogit2) %>%   # we save the result as a tidy object and...
    mutate(model = "Model 2")
#use 
mylogit3 <- glm(cashlove ~ purpose + vehicle +number_of_trips, data = mydata2, family = "binomial")
model3 = tidy(mylogit3) %>%   # we save the result as a tidy object and...
    mutate(model = "Model 3")
#use 
mylogit4 <- glm(cashlove ~ purpose + vehicle + number_of_trips + income, data = mydata2, family = "binomial")
model4 = tidy(mylogit4) %>%   # we save the result as a tidy object and...
    mutate(model = "Model 4")
summary(mylogit4)
```

**Comparing four models**

```{r compare different models}
allModels=rbind(model1, model2, model3, model4)

dwplot(allModels, vline = geom_vline(xintercept = 0, colour = "grey60", linetype = 2)) + 
  xlab("Coefficient Estimate") + 
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Predicting probability of using cash") +
  theme_bw()
```

From the plot above, we can see that compared with reference group, people in the highest income group are less likely to use cash, people whose purpose is home based work trip have less probability using cash, while people whose purpose is non-home based trip is more likely to use cash.
The more trips people have in each month, the less likelihood people would use cash. However, the difference on cash usage between people who have vehicles in home and people who don't is not significant.
